## Description
### Functionalities
The **V**ery **A**dvanced **T**ext **E**ditor VATE is a lightweight text editor that provides basic functionality for working with text files. The provided functionalities contain the following functions:

* Creating new files
* Opening existing files
* Saving edited files
* Saving edited files with a new path
* Exporting files to HTML
* Searching subtrings within the edited files

All these functionalites work while multiple files are opened simultaniously.

### Used Technologies
VATE's backend is developed with _Java_, with the frontend being developed with _Java Swing_. Therefore, VATE requires a working Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your computer that supports **Java 17** to run the program.

The project uses _Apache Maven_ as build tool.

As of 29 May 2023, the project's only external dependency is Google's [gson](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson).

After careful consideration, these technologies were chosen for their simplicity and customizability.
